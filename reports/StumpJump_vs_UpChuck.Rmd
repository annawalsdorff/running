It's very hard to get an idea of how difficult an ultramarathon course might be just by reading an elevation profile. Hopefully, it will show the 
[cumulative elevation gain/loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_elevation_gain), and it better show the altitude at which you'll be running. But it's really hard to judge how steep certain sections are. For example, the 
[StumpJump50k map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockcreek/9951932376/) looks like shark teeth. Many of the hills look straight up and down, but this is due to the map's 
[aspect ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio). Courses that are really long get squeezed so much that their hills can look incredibly daunting when in fact they may be gently rolling.

Using 
[my course data](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner/RUNNING/blob/master/data/RunningAHEAD_hornerj_log_20131023.xml)
 from 
[RunningAHEAD](http://www.runningahead.com/), I've created the following elevation maps comparing the StumpJump 50k to the UpChuck 50 (yet another excellent Rock/Creek race, with a 
[storied beginning](http://www.rockcreek.com/upchuck.rco)). The first shows the entire course for each race, while the subsequent maps show 5 mile sections providing a more accurate portrait of each climb. I've also developed a 
[crude algorithm](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner/RUNNING/blob/master/RunningAHEAD.R#L127) to detect notable sections with at least 100 meter ascents or descents at 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(slope)">10% grade</a>. The algorithm is a work in progress, but it does a nice job characterizing the StumpJump so I thought I'd see what it would do for the UpChuck.

Also check back next week as I'll provide a summary of UpChuck's historical finishing times in anticipation of it's next 
[running on November 9th](http://www.rockcreek.com/upchuck.rco).
